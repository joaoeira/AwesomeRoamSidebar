# Awesome Roam Sidebar

[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) is a note taking tool for networked thought, and it represents the highest increase in mental productivity since the invention of writing itself.

Nonetheless, it is not perfect, at least not for my preferences. One of the things that I found lacking was the inability to use the keyboard to navigate across the open sidebar pages and to reorder them when needed. Hence why I created Awesome Roam Sidebar, which as the name indicates, makes the Roam Sidebar, well, Awesome. 

With Awesome Roam Sidebar you can, using the keyboard:

1) Navigate around the sidebar - Use **Ctrl+Alt+K** (and **I**) to move one page down (and up)
2) Move sidebar pages around - Use **Alt+Shift+K** (and **I**) to move the currently selected page one place below (or above)
3) Close the currently selected page - Use **Ctrl+Alt+X**

There is an alternative version of Awesome Roam Sidebar for [Roam themes featuring a horizontal, rather than vertical, sidebar](https://github.com/azlen/roam-themes).

## Instructions

- If you are using the vanilla (vertical) Roam sidebar use the code in the file vanillaSidebarMovement.js
- If you are using a Zenith-like theme (horizontal sidebar) use the code in the file sidebarMovement.js
